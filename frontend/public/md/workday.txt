### What is this?

**Workday Simulator** is a silly little game where you race against the clock (speedrun) to fill out a workday form as quickly as possible. The game features a speedrun timer to challenge you to beat your best time. This project was primarily a fun way to practice my frontend development skills, especially with forms. It helped improve my proficiency React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
